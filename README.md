## Research

I study how NLP methods can be use to model 
language change and variation using different kinds of linguistic and 
palaeographic representations. The main challenges that I am working with
in this respect are how to inform models about linguistic knowledge/annotation and
how to interpret such models subsequently.
I am mainly been working with text, but I am also interested in using 
image processing as a means of representing visual features, such as handwriting or material, of a document.
